## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
 Our project focuses on analyzing customer profiles for a consumer finance company that is experiencing losses due to non-recoverable bad loans. Using Exploratory Data   
 Analysis (EDA) on the loan dataset, we aim to identify customers who are more likely to repay their loans, helping the company make better loan approval decisions.

- What is the background of your project?
Our project focuses on a consumer finance company that provides various types of loans to urban customers. The company has been experiencing losses due to a significant number of bad loans that are non-recoverable (charged-off). To address this issue, we aim to analyze the profiles of customers whose loans were approved to identify patterns that can help in better decision-making regarding loan approvals.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The primary goal of the project is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify customers who are likely to repay their loans. By doing this, the company can minimize the risk of approving loans to high-risk customers, thereby reducing financial losses. The objective is to assist the company in making data-driven decisions to improve loan approval processes.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The project uses a Loan Dataset, which contains details of customers and their loan applications. Additionally, a data dictionary has been provided to explain the variables in the dataset.

## Conclusions
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the provided loan dataset, we were able to identify key characteristics of customers who are more likely to repay their loans, such as stable income, lower debt-to-income ratios, and positive credit histories. 
These insights can help the company refine its loan approval process, reducing the risk of approving high-risk loans and improving overall profitability.
Implementing data-driven decision-making will allow the company to make more informed choices, ultimately minimizing financial losses from charged-off loans.
